# lab 2

Launch is pretty straight forward.
Launch the program specified in the command line via forking and exec and report some stuff, so I made a method that handles the forking, and another that handles preparing argv for the program that will be launched in the child. This will hopefully give me some leverage that'll help make tube.c easier to make.
